# Quiz-Whiz-Web-App

<p> Developed a Teaching Assistant (TA) Demo Quiz application with the primary objective of providing students with a simulated quiz experience. This application offers multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and each student receives a unique set of questions. To ensure timely completion, students are required to submit their answers within a given time limit. Failure to do so will result in the expiration of the MCQs.
